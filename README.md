# Dungeons & Dragons Lite (C Version)

## Overview

This is a simplified version of a Dungeons & Dragons-style game written in C. The player creates a character by rolling dice to determine their stats (Strength and Health) and engages in turn-based combat with a monster. The goal is to reduce the monster’s health to zero before the player’s health runs out.

## Features

- **Character Creation**: Player stats (Strength and Health) are randomly generated by rolling dice.
- **Monster Creation**: A random monster with its own Strength and Health is created.
- **Turn-Based Combat**: Players and monsters take turns attacking and defending.
- **Dice Rolls**: Dice rolls determine the outcome of attacks and defenses.
- **Win/Loss Condition**: The player wins if the monster's health is reduced to zero before their own health is depleted.

## Requirements

- C Compiler (e.g., GCC)

## Compilation Instructions

1. Copy the source code into a file, e.g., `dnd_game.c`.
2. Open your terminal/command prompt.
3. Compile the program using the following command:
    ```bash
    gcc -o dnd_game dnd_game.c
    ```
4. Run the program:
    ```bash
    ./dnd_game
    ```

## Gameplay Instructions

1. Upon starting the game, the program will roll for the player's character stats (Strength and Health).
2. A monster will be created with random Strength and Health.
3. Players and the monster will alternate turns attacking and defending:
    - The player rolls to attack, and the monster rolls to defend.
    - The monster then attacks, and the player defends.
4. The game continues until either the player's or the monster's health reaches zero.
5. Press **Enter** to continue each turn of the combat phase.
